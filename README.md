# Phil-s-Show-Rater

This is a stand-alone web page that I developed for fun to aggregate movie and TV show ratings from renowned media raters including IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and Netflix. The user can enter any movie/TV show title into the input text area at the top of the screen, and the page will display the scores of the ratings from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and Netflix, as well as a weighted average of the ratings, called the 'Phil Rating'.

I have uploaded the web page to www.philipgabardo.com/scorer.html.
